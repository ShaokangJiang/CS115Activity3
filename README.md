# CS115Activity3

This is an activity project for class CS115.

Here is the original question:

A magic square of order n is an arrangement of n*n numbers, usually distinct integers, in a square, such that the n numbers in all rows, all columns, and both diagonals sum to the same constant. Here are two files. For each file: open the file, and check that all rows indeed sum to the same constant.

This is a solution using RandomAccess method.
